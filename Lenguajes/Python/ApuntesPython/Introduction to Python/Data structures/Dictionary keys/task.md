## Dictionary keys

Try to figure out what's wrong with this dictionary and fix it.

When fixing, be aware of the following requirements
- Since dictionary keys can only be of immutable types, replace the list with several individual `key:value` pairs with keys of type `str` or with a tuple.
- Since keys need to be unique, rename one of the `Bob` keys to a name of your choice.
